# Resolve an address to its tracing project

> Returns the tracing project (session) an address names. An address is an AGENT (`id` and `environment`), an EXPERIMENT (`id`), or an EVALUATOR (no `id`: evaluator traces share one project per workspace). Send `kind` and `environment` in upper case, as listed; they are matched case-insensitively, while the Agent `id` is case-sensitive. An address that does not exist, or whose project you cannot read, is a 404. Pass the returned `session_id` to any endpoint that takes a project (session) ID. This is not supported on a BYOC data plane yet, and is a 501 there. Self-hosted deployments need LangSmith v0.18 or later.
