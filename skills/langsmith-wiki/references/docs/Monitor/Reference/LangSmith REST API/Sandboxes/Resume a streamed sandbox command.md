# Resume a streamed sandbox command

> Continue streaming a command started by the stream start endpoint. The offsets are also the ack for everything below them, which frees the sandbox's output buffer and unpauses a command waiting for room. Attaches only: a command the sandbox no longer has returns 404 rather than running again.
